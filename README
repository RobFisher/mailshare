Mailshare receives email and presents it in a web interface. CC your
discussions to your Mailshare server's email address. Emails can then
be viewed in a web browser.

This is intended to be used in a team as an alternative to forwarding
emails to the whole team.

Installation
============

1. Copy the file settings_example.py to settings.py
2. Edit settings.py, supplying database details for storing emails and
IMAP details for retrieving them.

3. Create a database with MySQL, e.g.:
     mysql -u root -p
     CREATE DATABASE mailshare

4. Let Django set up the database: python manage.py syncdb

     Say yes and answer the prompts when asked to set up a super user
     for Django's authentication system. Later this will be used for
     the admin interface.

Use
===

python manage.py shell
>>> import mailshare.mailshareapp.process_emails
>>> mailshare.mailshareapp.process_emails.quick_test()

This downloads 10 emails from the email server and puts them into the
database. You should now have a database containing up to 10
emails. All information from the mail server is also logged to a file
called mailfile. You can delete the database and replay previously
downloaded messages from this file with:

>>> mailshare.mailshareapp.process_emails.quick_test(True)

To view the database contents, start the Django test server with:

python manage.py runserver

Visit http://localhost:8000/admin/mailshareapp/mail/ to see the
emails.

Environment
===========

For information, here is how I set up my environment in Ubuntu
10.04. Other platforms will be supported but I have to start
somewhere.

Install these Ubuntu packages:

lampserver^
libabache2-mod-python
phpmyadmin

 - Apache and MySQL; hook Apache up to Python; and phpMyAdmin to see
 what the database looks like.

python-MySQLdb
 - Hook Python up to MySQL.

python-utidylib
python-lxml
 - I'm probably going to render HTML mails in the web interface. These
 should be useful.

Python libraries:
sudo apt-get install python-setuptools
sudo easy_install django
sudo easy_install django-dajaxice
sudo easy_install django-dajax
