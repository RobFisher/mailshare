Mailshare receives email and presents it in a web interface. CC your
discussions to your Mailshare server's email address. Emails can then
be viewed in a web browser.

This is intended to be used in a team as an alternative to forwarding
emails to the whole team.

Just starting; nothing works yet; watch this space.

Installation
============

1. Copy the file settings_example.py to settings.py
2. Edit settings.py, supplying database details for storing emails and
IMAP details for retrieving them.

3. Create a database with MySQL, e.g.:
     mysql -u root -p
     CREATE DATABASE mailshare

4. Let Django set up the database:
     cd mailshare_web
     python manage.py syncdb
   Say yes and answer the prompts when asked to set up a super user
   for Django's authentication system. We'll probably use this for
   something one day.

Use
===

python process_emails.py

See what happens!

Environment
===========

For information, here is how I set up my environment in Ubuntu
10.04. Other platforms will be supported but I have to start
somewhere.

lampserver^
libabache2-mod-python
phpmyadmin

 - Apache and MySQL; hook Apache up to Python; and phpMyAdmin to see
 what the database looks like.

python-MySQLdb
 - Hook Python up to MySQL.

python-django
python-django-doc
 - I'm probably going to use Django for the web and database
 stuff. For setting up Django under Ubuntu, see
 https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Django
