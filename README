discussions to your Mailshare server's email address. Emails can then
be viewed in a web browser.

This is intended to be used in a team as an alternative to forwarding
emails to the whole team.

Evironment
==========

For information, here is how I set up my environment in Ubuntu
10.04. Other platforms will be supported but I have to start
somewhere.

python3
 - I want to code in Python 3 but none of the big web frameworks
 support it.

lampserver^
libabache2-mod-python
phpmyadmin

 - Apache and MySQL. Hook Apache up to Python and phpMyAdmin to see
 what the database looks like.

python-django
python-django-doc
 - I'm probably going to use Django for the web and database
 stuff. For setting up Django under Ubuntu, see
 https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Django
